# Community-bridges (Inter-Theoretical Links)

## Definition & Conceptual Goal

The **Community-Bridges** metric evaluates the nature of cross-community connections in the global
*[theory-holon](../../../glossary.md#theorie-holon)*
([Balzer et al., 1987, pp. 224–225, 317, 324](zotero://select/library/items/24SNSW2B)).

It identifies nodes that act as structural bridges between distinct scientific communities and checks whether these
bridge nodes represent **genuine theoretical translations/constraints** ($C$) or merely superficial, ad-hoc lexical
co-occurrences.

## Theoretical Grounding & Model Formulation

In the structuralist conception, different theory-nets connect into a macro-structure called the theory-holon via
**inter-theoretical links** ($\lambda \subseteq M_p (T_1) \times M_p (T_2)$).

These links typically originate from the fundamental cores ($T_0$) or bridging nodes of one discipline (e.g.,
thermodynamics) into another (e.g., statistical mechanics). If bridge edges lack rigorous formal constraints, the global
scientific network loses its **global homogeneity** and structural cohesion.

## Mathematical Specification & Graph Formulation

Let $G$ be a theory graph as defined in the **[Formal Graph Schema (TheoryNet)](../../../formal_graph_model.md)**, partitioned into communities such that each node $v \in V$ is assigned to a community $c(v)$.

Let $E_{\text{cross}} = \{ e = (u, v) \in E \mid c(u) \neq c(v)\}$ be the set of inter-community boundary edges.
Let $\Lambda_{\text{formal}} = \{\mathsf{specializes}, \mathsf{derives\_from}, \mathsf{explains}\}$ be the set of formal inter-theoretical relation types.

### Edge Betweenness Centrality on Cross-Community Edges

The betweenness centrality of an edge $e \in E_{\text{cross}}$ is:

$$C_B(e) = \sum_{s \neq t \in V} \frac{\sigma_{st}(e)}{\sigma_{st}}$$

where $\sigma_{st}$ is the total number of shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ and $\sigma_{st}(e)$ is the number of those
paths passing through edge $e$.

### Bridge Constraint Integrity Ratio (BCIR)

To evaluate whether high-betweenness bridges carry formal constraints:

$$\operatorname{BCIR}(G) = \frac{|\{e \in E_{\text{cross}} \mid C_B(e) \ge \tau \land \lambda_e(e) \in \Lambda_{\text{formal}}\}|}{|\{e \in E_{\text{cross}} \mid C_B(e) \ge \tau\}|}$$

where $\tau$ is a high-betweenness threshold (e.g., top 10th percentile) and $\lambda_e(e)$ denotes the relation type of edge $e$.

## Measurement & Graph Implementation

1. **Calculate Betweenness**: Run edge and node betweenness centrality using the Graph Data Science library.
2. **Filter Boundary Edges**: Isolate edges that span across distinct Louvain/Leiden community boundaries.
3. **Verify Constraints**: Validate whether the bridge edges are typed as formal inter-theoretical constraints ($C$) or
   loose associations.

|:--------------------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $\text{BCIR} \approx 1.0$ | Homogeneous Integration   | Strong theoretical reduction or inter-disciplinary translation across paradigms.                |
| $\text{BCIR} \ll 0.5$     | Fragile / Ad-Hoc Bridging | Communities are linked by weak or ambiguous associations rather than formal conceptual mapping. |
