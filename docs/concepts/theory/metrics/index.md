# Theory Metrics Overview & Taxonomy

This document provides a consolidated taxonomy, mathematical specification, and overlap analysis of all metascientific,
structuralist, topological, coherence, and evolutionary metrics used to evaluate reconstructed theory graphs in Episteme.

The metrics are conceptually and mathematically organized into **five foundational pillars**, underpinned by a global
connectionist relaxation engine.

Click on any metric title in the tables below for its dedicated formulation, algorithmic implementation, and metascientific
diagnostic guidelines.

## Central Algorithmic Engine

Some metrics are calculated explicitly via targeted graph algorithms, while others are resolved dynamically through a global
relaxation model.

| Metric | Definition & Conceptual Goal | Measurement Approach | Specific Algorithm, Formula, or Mathematical Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**The LPG-ECHO Algorithm**](./adapted_echo_algorithm.md) [4, p. 435–467] | Central connectionist engine for parallel constraint satisfaction, resolving belief propagation, conflict resolution, systemic decay, and global coherence. | Executes synchronous / asynchronous relaxation loops across the multi-relational property graph until convergence. | Assigns continuous epistemic status $a_i^* \in [-1, 1]$ to every node. Updates: $a_j(t+1) = a_j(t)(1-\theta) + \text{net}_j(t)(a_{\max} - a_j(t))$ for $\text{net}_j > 0$. Intrinsic decay half-life: $t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(0.5)}{\ln(1-\theta)} \approx 13.5$ iterations at $\theta = 0.05$. |

## Pillar 1: Structural and Topological Metrics

Evaluates the **physical graph layout, hierarchy, community segmentation, bottlenecks, and topological robustness** of the local intra-theory graph (*theory-net*) or global inter-theory graph (*[theory-holon](../../glossary.md#theorie-holon)*).

## Metric Overlap, Redundancy, & Consolidation Analysis

Because formal philosophy of science, structuralism, and network theory approach theoretical virtues from multiple angles, several metrics exhibit mathematical or conceptual overlap. The following analysis clarifies these relationships and documents our architectural consolidation strategy.

### In-Depth Analysis: What About Unification? Do We Need It?

The **Unification** metric ($U_{\text{ratio}} = |D| / |B|$) occupies a central place in classical philosophy of science (Kitcher, 1989; Schurz, 2024), formalizing the intuition that a good theory unifies diverse phenomena under a minimal axiomatic foundation.

#### Where Unification Overlaps:
1. **Overlap with Explanatory Breadth ($REB$):**
   - Both metrics measure explanatory yield. The derived elements set $D$ in an empirical graph consists predominantly of explained observation nodes ($V_E^{\text{exp}}$).
   - *Key Distinction*: Explanatory Breadth ($REB = |V_E^{\text{exp}}| / |V_E|$) evaluates **domain coverage** (what fraction of known evidence is explained), but is completely agnostic to how many axioms were needed to achieve that coverage. An ad-hoc system that introduces 100 axioms to explain 100 facts achieves a perfect $REB = 1.0$, but its Unification Ratio collapses to $100 / 100 = 1.0$ (severely un-unified). Unification penalizes axiomatic fragmentation.
2. **Overlap with Minimum Description Length ($MDL$) & Elegance & Economy:**
   - In algorithmic information theory, $MDL(T) = L(M) + L(D \mid M)$ is the precise mathematical continuous counterpart to discrete Unification.
   - $L(M)$ represents the complexity of the axiom base ($B$), while $L(D \mid M)$ represents the cost of uncompressed/unexplained empirical data ($D$). A high Unification Ratio directly corresponds to minimizing total description length: a compact model $M$ compressing a large data mass $D$.
3. **Implicit Enforcement in the LPG-ECHO Algorithm:**
   - As documented in [adapted_echo_algorithm.md](./adapted_echo_algorithm.md), the connectionist relaxation engine organically enforces unification. Clamped evidence nodes pump activation into the network, while systemic decay $\theta$ bleeds activation each cycle. If a theory contains too many axioms ($B$) relative to verified empirical anchor points ($D$), activation is diluted and the excess axioms decay to zero ("ghost nodes").

#### Architectural Verdict on Unification:
!!! tip
    **Decision: Retain as a Macro-Diagnostic Ratio.**
    We retain Unification as an explicit, high-level diagnostic ratio because:
    
    1. **Computational Efficiency**: Calculating $U_{\text{ratio}} = |D| / |B|$ requires only simple $O(1)$ node-degree queries on the deductive derivation DAG (`MATCH (b) WHERE NOT (b)<-[:DERIVED_FROM]-()`), avoiding the overhead of full MDL estimation or iterative ECHO convergence.
    2. **Conceptual Interpretability**: It provides domain scholars with an immediately legible quotient reflecting the classical Kitcher-Schurz unification standard.
    3. **Role in Taxonomy**: Rather than a primitive property, Unification is formalized as the macro quotient of **Empirical Output ($D \approx REB$)** over **Axiomatic Base ($B \approx 1/APS$)**.

### Comprehensive Overlap & Redundancy Map

The table below outlines all overlapping metric pairs, their formal relationships, and their consolidation status across the codebase and documentation:

| Metric Pair / Cluster | Overlapping Elements | Formal Relationship | Consolidation Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **True Partial Empirical Claim** $\leftrightarrow$ **Empirical Adequacy** | Both verify non-empty paradigm applications ($I_0 \neq \emptyset, I_0 \in \operatorname{Cn}(K)$). | `True Partial Empirical Claim` is identical to the Grounding Ratio ($GR(T) = \|I_{\text{confirmed}}\| / \|I_{\text{total}}\|$) in Empirical Adequacy. | **Absorbed**: Fully integrated as the baseline condition ($GR > 0$) of [Empirical Adequacy](./empirical_power/empirical_adequacy.md). |
| **Unexplained Evidence Ratio ($UER$)** $\leftrightarrow$ **Explanatory Breadth ($REB$)** | Both track evidence coverage vs. omissions in empirical domain $V_E$. | $UER(T) = \frac{\|V_E^{\text{unexp}}\|}{\|V_E\|} = 1 - REB_{\text{NODE}}(T)$. It is the arithmetic complement of relative coverage. | **Absorbed**: Defined directly inside [Explanatory Breadth](./empirical_power/explanatory_breadth.md) (Sec. 3.4) as the passive omission gap. |
| **Immunization Tracking ($II, RPI$)** $\leftrightarrow$ **Degeneration Index ($D, \Delta D$)** | Both detect ad-hoc auxiliary hypotheses resolving anomalies without excess empirical content ($\Delta_{\text{content}} = 0$). | Node-level immunization ($II$) aggregates directly into Schurz's version-level Degeneration Index ($D(V_j)$) as Typ-b failures. | **Unified**: Merged into [Degeneration Index & Immunization Tracking](./theory_dynamics/degeneration_index.md). |
| **Evolution Perfectness ($EPR$)** $\leftrightarrow$ **Progressiveness ($\Pi_{Cn}$)** | Both evaluate the transition of open conjectures $A(I)$ into confirmed successes $F(I)$ over time. | Perfectness is the asymptotic efficiency limit ($EPR_{Cn}$) of a diachronic research programme evolution $\mathcal{E}$. | **Integrated**: Formalized as the asymptotic efficiency component ($EPR_{Cn}$) in [Progressiveness](./theory_dynamics/progressiveness.md). |
| **System Tolerance & Skepticism ($\theta$)** $\leftrightarrow$ **LPG-ECHO Algorithm** | Both model belief decay $a_i(t) = a_i(0)(1-\theta)^t$ and belief half-life $t_{1/2}$. | Skepticism is an intrinsic control parameter of the connectionist relaxation loop, not an independent topological metric. | **Integrated**: Formalized as an intrinsic mechanic in [The LPG-ECHO Algorithm](./adapted_echo_algorithm.md). |
| **Simplicity** $\leftrightarrow$ **Elegance and Economy** | Both operationalize Ockham's razor and Minimum Description Length (MDL). | Decoupled by structural scale: Simplicity governs micro-level explanation chains ($\phi(a, b) \propto 1/\sum c(a_j)$) and graph entropy; Elegance & Economy governs macro theory cores ($APS$, $L(M) + L(D \mid M)$). | **Paired (S&E)**: Retained as complementary multi-scale parsimony metrics. |
| **Connectedness + Modesty** $\leftrightarrow$ **Structural Elegance Index** | Balances algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) against inverse graph density ($1/\rho$). | Composite index: $E(G) = \lambda_2(G) - \alpha \rho(G)$. | **Hierarchical**: Structural Elegance is the composite index; Connectedness and Modesty are foundational inputs. |
| **Homogeneity + Refutability + Connectivity** $\leftrightarrow$ **Bottleneck Fragility Profile** | Unifies degree entropy ($H_{\text{deg}}$), vertex connectivity ($\kappa$), and betweenness shortest-path drop ($R_k$). | Composite diagnostic report evaluating single points of failure and collapse impact. | **Hierarchical**: Bottleneck Fragility Profile is the composite diagnostic; individual metrics serve as foundational inputs. |
| **Epistemic Safety** $\leftrightarrow$ **LPG-ECHO Node Activation** | Both model confidence propagation from empirical grounding to theoretical conclusions. | Safety is the single maximum-reliability path product; ECHO is the multi-path connectionist relaxation across the full network. | **Complementary**: Safety provides deterministic path bounds; ECHO provides continuous network equilibrium. |
