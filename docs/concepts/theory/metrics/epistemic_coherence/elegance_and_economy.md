# Elegance And Economy

## Definition & Conceptual Goal

The **Elegance and Economy** metric evaluates the parsimony and mathematical efficiency of a theory's formalization
([Balzer et al., 1987, p. xviii](zotero://select/library/items/24SNSW2B); [Schurz, 2024, sec. 5.2](zotero://select/library/items/24SNSW2B)).

Following the principle of Ockham's Razor, scientific theories should minimize unnecessary mathematical baggage,
extraneous axioms, and surplus primitive concepts while maximizing descriptive power.

At its core, this metric treats **learning as data compression**: any regularity in the data can be used to compress it.
A scientific theory is essentially a language or model for describing empirical observations. The more a theory is able
to compress the data (i.e., to describe it using fewer symbols than describing the data literally), the more we have
learned about the underlying regularities ([Grünwald, 2005](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/1114.003.0004)).

## Theoretical Grounding & Minimum Description Length

In model theory and algorithmic information theory, economy is evaluated through **Axiomatic Cardinality** (minimizing
primitive axioms $|Ax|$) and algorithmic complexity.

Ideally, we would identify the most elegant theory by finding the program with the lowest **Kolmogorov complexity**—the
absolute shortest computer program capable of generating the data. However, idealized Kolmogorov complexity is
problematic in practice for two reasons ([Grünwald, 2005](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/1114.003.0004)):

1. **Uncomputability:** It is mathematically impossible to construct an algorithm that reliably finds the absolute
   shortest program for any given data set.
2. **Arbitrariness (Dependence on Syntax):** For small samples, the chosen hypothesis relies heavily on arbitrary
   details of the specific programming language syntax used for the encoding.

Because of this uncomputability and arbitrariness, we instead rely on the **Practical Minimum Description Length (MDL)**
principle. Practical MDL scales down the idealized approach by using restricted, well-defined description methods (like
our graph structures) rather than general-purpose Turing machines, allowing us to compute and compare the descriptive
lengths of competing theories without falling victim to syntax arbitrariness.

## Mathematical Specification & Graph Formulation

Let $T = \langle K, I \rangle$ be a reconstructed theory-element with axiom set $Ax (T)$ and parameter set $\Theta (T)$.

### Axiom Parsimony Score ($APS$)

The $APS$ provides a normalized (0 to 1) heuristic of structural elegance, heavily penalizing the initial introduction
of axioms while applying a sublinear (logarithmic) penalty for highly complex theories.

$$APS (T) = \frac{1}{1 + \log_2 (1 + |Ax (T)|) + \log_2 (1 + |\Theta (T)|)}$$

### Minimum Description Length ($MDL$)

Using the two-part practical MDL principle, we evaluate the overall complexity as:

$$MDL (T) = L (M) + L (D \mid M)$$

To compute these lengths within our QBAF-based [TheoryNet](../../../formal_graph_model.md) architecture ($V = A \cup B$),
we map the $MDL$ components directly onto the network's abstract argumentation structure. Rather than computing raw
bits, we approximate description length via graph-structural complexity:

#### $L (M)$ (Theory Description Length)

$L (M)$ represents the intrinsic complexity of the theory core. We define the core as a
subgraph $G_{core} = (A_{core}, R_{core})$, where $A_{core} \subseteq A$ (Theoretical Antecedents)
and $R_{core} \subseteq \mathcal{R}_{att} \cup \mathcal{R}_{sup}$ are the logical relations connecting them.

$$L (M) = w_n \cdot |A_{core}| + w_e \cdot |R_{core}|$$

Here, $w_n$ and $w_e$ denote structural weight penalties for nodes and edges.

#### $L (D \mid M)$ (Data Description Length)

$L (D \mid M)$ measures the residual cost of encoding the empirical base $B$ (Empirical Observation Sentences) given the
theory core. This cost is determined by the mapping laws $Z (a,b)$ bridging $A_{core}$ to $B$.

$$L (D \mid M) = \sum_{b \in B} c (b \mid A_{core})$$

To align with the QBAF relation weights ($\phi \in [0,1]$), the cost function is normalized such
that $c (b \mid A_{core}) \in [0, 1]$:

* **$c \to 0$ (Explained Data):** Strong supportive mapping laws ($\mathcal{R}_{sup}$ with high weight $\phi$)
  successfully compress the observation.
* **$c \to 1$ (Unexplained Data / Noise):** Contradictory mapping laws ($\mathcal{R}_{att}$) or the absence of
  structural isomorphism incur the maximum penalty, requiring the literal encoding of the isolated node $b$.

Consequently, the total data description length is bounded by $0 \le L (D \mid M) \le |B|$, yielding a highly
interpretable metric where $0$ indicates perfect empirical coverage and $|B|$ indicates total explanatory failure.

## Diagnostic & Metascientific Value

| $APS$ Score          | Formal Economy         | Metascientific Interpretation                                             |
|:---------------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High $APS$ ($> 0.7$) | Elegant & Parsimonious | Compact mathematical core deriving rich empirical theorems.               |
| Low $APS$ ($< 0.3$)  | Bloated / Complex      | Redundant or unpruned formal definitions with excess conceptual overhead. |
