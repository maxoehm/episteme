| **Text as Theory Repository**    | Authorial ambiguity, informal prose, and unstated enthymemes.                     | Episodic working memory context, verbatim character span provenance, and confidence scoring.                      |

## Core Epistemic & Methodological Assumptions

### Text as Theory Repository

**Assumption:** Scholarly texts contain explicit or implicit theoretical frameworks that can be computationally
extracted, structured, and topologically represented.

**Implications & Constraints:**

- The pipeline is optimized for academic, peer-reviewed monographs and journal articles.
- Applicability to casual, purely descriptive, or narrative texts is limited.
- Extraction quality remains bounded by authorial clarity, argumentative rigor, and structural transparency.

### LLM Extraction Competence

**Assumption:** State-of-the-art Large Language Models possess sufficient semantic and syntactical competence to
identify technical philosophical concepts and reconstruct defeasible arguments.

**Implications & Constraints:**

- Quality is strictly dependent on underlying model pretraining distributions and instruction-following fidelity.
- Systematic training biases (e.g., preference for contemporary Western analytic philosophy over continental or
  non-Western traditions) can distort extraction.

### Compositional Theory Structure

**Assumption:** Theoretical frameworks can be decomposed into discrete entities, relations, axioms, and arguments
without destroying their essential scientific meaning.

**Implications & Constraints:**

- Risk of reductionism: Highly nuanced, holistic philosophical worldviews can lose subtle rhetorical interdependencies
  when forced into discrete nodes and edges.
- Mitigated by our multi-layer approach, which preserves continuous textual provenance for every assertion.

## Technical & Operational Limitations

### Scalability Constraints

* **Graph Database Traversal:** As the graph scales to millions of nodes, complex Cypher pattern matching across
  recursive argument paths incurs noticeable latency.
* **Vector Indexing Overhead:** Maintaining high-dimensional dense embeddings for every entity mention and argument
  component requires substantial RAM and vector storage.
* **Sequential Dependencies:** While individual chunk extraction is embarrassingly parallel, global relation discovery
  and community fusion (Leiden clustering) require synchronization barriers.

### Accuracy Boundaries Across Tasks

* **Entity Extraction & Disambiguation:** Fine-grained typing (distinguishing a *School of Thought* from a
  *Methodological Paradigm*)
  exhibits lower inter-annotator agreement than coarse named entity recognition.
* **Implicit Relation Discovery:** Relationships spanning distant book chapters or between different works are
  inherently harder to detect than local, intra-chunk triples.
* **Argument Component Classification:** Distinguishing a *Premise* from an *Intermediate Claim* often hinges on
  rhetorical context that exceeds single-chunk attention windows.

### Language & Domain Coverage

* **Primary Language Support:** Episteme is explicitly engineered for German and English scientific and philosophical
  literature.
* **Domain Adaptation:** While the underlying architecture is generalizable, prompt templates, schemas, and stop-words
  are heavily tuned to philosophy, sociology, and history of science.

## Practical Guidelines for Scholarly Interpretation

To ensure responsible scholarly use of pipeline outputs:

1. **Verify Evidence Spans:** Always trace extracted claims and relations back to their verbatim source character spans
   via the provenance metadata.
2. **Inspect Confidence & Calibration:** Pay close attention to relation confidence scores and calibration metrics.
3. **Account for Historical Context:** Avoid presentist bias by interpreting theoretical assertions relative to the
   author's contemporary empirical horizon ($B (t)$), rather than modern scientific consensus.
4. **Treat Graphs as Hypotheses:** Regard generated Theory Graphs as structured interpretative hypotheses that serve as
   starting points for human hermeneutic analysis.
