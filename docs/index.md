## What is T-Episteme?

_grund.Episteme_ is a research library designed to construct **theory graphs**—structured representations of theoretical
frameworks—from academic texts in German and English. While designed for computational epistemologists, NLP researchers,
and philosophers of science, the pipeline itself focuses on an agnostic and approach for knowledge graph construction
and may serve different use cases as well.

Our pipeline abstracts unstructured scholarly documents into queryable semantic structures. Unlike traditional knowledge
graphs that focus on factual relationships, theory graphs capture the conceptual and argumentative structures that
underpin scientific theories. The pipeline transforms unstructured scholarly documents into a property graph, that can be stored in any graph database of your choosing. The episteme-pipeline produced a three-layer architecture:

1. **Layer 1 (Provenance Embedding)**: Original documents embedded and queryable in the graph.
2. **Layer 2 (Knowledge Graph)**: Abstraction from original sources as a knowledge graph.
3. **Layer 3 (Theory Framework)**: Higher-level theoretical constructs and argumentative structures.
