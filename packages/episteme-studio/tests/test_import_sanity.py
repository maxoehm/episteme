"""Import-sanity tests for the episteme_studio package.

Guards against import-time breakage across the entire studio package,
including the ``episteme_studio.adapters.worker`` entry point that launches the
pipeline in a subprocess (pipeline.py:417). This is the general guard
for the ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'phases'`` failure that
previously surfaced when starting a pipeline from the studio worker: the
studio worker imports ``episteme_pipeline.runtime.runner``, which referenced the
top-level ``phases`` namespace instead of ``episteme_pipeline.phases``.
