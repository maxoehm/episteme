    Base for every pipeline phase. Each phase accepts a typed input contract
    and returns an artifact collection. Phases may still project to the graph incrementally for crash resilience, but artifact collections are the runtime handoff.

    The Pipeline class composes PhaseRunner instances into a DAG and exposes
    .run(), .run_phase(n), and .run_from_phase(n).

    Dispatch contract (O-09)
    ------------------------
    The orchestrator needs three things from a phase that ``name`` cannot
    safely supply: which config block to fingerprint, whether to persist its
    artifacts, and which artifact view to feed it. Those used to be recovered
    by string-matching ``name`` (``name.startswith("Phase 3b")``), which made a
    display string load-bearing — renaming a phase silently changed its
    behaviour, and the match order mattered ("Phase 3b" had to be tested before
    "Phase 3"). They are now explicit class attributes.
