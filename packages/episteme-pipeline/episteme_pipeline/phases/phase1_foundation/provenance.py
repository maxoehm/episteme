"""
Deterministic ID generation and provenance helpers for Phase 1.

IDs are SHA-256 based so re-running the pipeline on the same input
produces the same IDs → MERGE writes to Neo4j are idempotent.

Identity rules
---------------------
``doc_id`` hashes the *canonical source path*, not the file stem. Hashing the
stem alone collapsed ``a/intro.md`` and ``b/intro.md`` into a single Document
node, silently interleaving two corpora.

``chunk_id`` deliberately keeps a fingerprint of the chunk text. Chunk identity
is content-addressed on purpose: the artifact fingerprint/reuse machinery, the
per-phase ``*_processed`` checkpoints and the embedding cache all key off the
chunk id, so an edited paragraph *must* produce a new id or the pipeline would
happily serve stale downstream results. The cost is that re-ingesting an edited
document leaves the previous chunk nodes behind; Phase 1 therefore prunes them
explicitly (see ``GraphWriter.prune_document_children``) instead of letting them
accumulate.

Provenance is split into two dictionaries because ``SET n += $props`` on every
run made the graph byte-unstable: ``ingested_at`` was rewritten on every node on
every run, so nothing was ever comparable across runs. ``base_provenance``
carries only values that are constant for a given source, and
``creation_provenance`` carries the first-seen timestamp, written through
``ON CREATE SET``. "Last seen" is a property of the run manifest, not of the
graph.
